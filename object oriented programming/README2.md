object oriented programming
==============================

Planning and designing
------------------------

1. identify nouns e.g. a <b>customer</b> opens an <b>account</b>
2. indicate the relationships - customer opens account. customer to account - one to many, account to customer - one to two
3. Define classes - e.g. account class and customer class
4. Analyse attributes and behaviours - e.g. what information do we store about the account - sort code, name, number, balance, type - current or savings, overdraft
what are the behaviours e.g. withdrawal (depends on the account type), deposit
5. Define attributes that all accounts have
6. Define attribues that certain accounts have. They inherit other attributes from the base class (e.g. current account inherits from account)

N.b. write a system in terms of an interface rather than in terms of a class
